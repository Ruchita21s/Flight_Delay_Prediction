# Flight_Delay_Prediction
 This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning techniques implemented in PySpark. By leveraging a dataset containing various flight-related features, including departure time, carrier, distance, and delay information, the project builds and evaluates predictive models to assist airlines in proactively managing flight delays.
